Hi! I'm David, a <b>Master's student</b> in Computer Science at <b>ETH ZÃ¼rich</b>, specializing in <b>Cybersecurity</b> and <b>Machine Intelligence</b>. My research interests are centered around <b>Privacy Enhancing Technologies</b> (PETs), especially their applications in private learning and humanitarian contexts.

This summer, I'll be joining Dr. [Wouter Lueks](https://wouterlueks.nl/) at <b>CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</b> as a research intern focused on PETs. Previously, I've had the opportunity to conduct research in Post-Quantum Cryptography at <b>EPFL's LASEC group</b> under [Laurane Marco](https://lauranemarco.github.io/), and in applied cryptography at the <b>French National Center for Scientific Research</b> (CNRS)/LIP6 with [Damien Vergnaud](https://perso.lip6.fr/Damien.Vergnaud/).

Before joining ETH, I earned dual bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from <b>Sorbonne University</b> in Paris.
